the list of tests, should be Density Histogram instead of Intensity Grids.
- Fixed coding error with save_grids where 'ground' was sent as gridtype for Grid Density By Class test
instead of class name for each class selected.
- Fixed coding error where the generate grids function would exit early without errors and no grids in output.

v1.3.1

single file where the file name is regardless of the extension.
- Added print statments when a test starts running and when said test is complete.

"Tiled LiDAR (classified)").
- LiQCS_summary.txt file created in output detailing input and output paths, tests, and runtime.
- A folder of last return lasinfo files can be used as input if LiDAR Summary is the only test selected.
- Fixed filenaming test, the year at the end of the filename was not accounted for.

v1.2.4
- GUI: Lasinfo run ground? prompt now pops up when lasinfo and any other tests are added to queue.
- File Naming: Fixed issue where all filenames are considered correct.

v1.2.3
- LiDAR Summary: Added scale factor(x,y,z) to output.
- LiDAR Summary: Added Min and Max z values to output (just x,y in previous versions).
- GUI: Changed addToQueue code to be more readable and set default values for queueDict variables in 
checkReq so that keyError: 'run_ground' wont happen.
- GUI: Lasinfo run ground? prompt now pops up when lasinfo and any other tests except for Density Histogram
are added to queue.
- GUI: Added CPU cores dropdown to edit queue popup and changed layout to more closely resemble the main GUI.
- Lasinfo, read_lidar: Added MEIPASS to path where lastools is added if LiQCS is an executable.

- Added -fl "file list" option from original command line version.
- Added prompt when the lasinfo test is selected for the user to decide whether or not to create 
ground lasinfos. If the ground density grid test is selected the user will not be prompted with 
this option.
- Cleaned up help and about pages.
- Removed Raw File Naming test and moved the functionality to the File Naming test so that if a file name
passes either test the name is considered correct and bad if it fails both.
- Removed LiDAR QC Prep button and added LiDAR QC Prep as a test.

v1.2.1
- Added Lidar Qc Prep as button that creates a popup window. Based off LiDAR_QC_Prep.py script
- Void Check test fixed

v1.2.0
- Added queue system to run multiple tests one after the other.
- lidar_summary: if version number from lasinfo is not found "Failed to grab version" is placed in
